# OnWater Code Challenge - Job Applicant Report

job-applicant-report is a JavaScript and React frontend that turns json data into an HTML page. The data.json files contain sample data.

Use a json server to see the app in a development environment.

React component structure:

MainPage  
--- Header --< table_data  
--< JobType --< Applicant --< Skill --< table_data  
--- Footer --- table_data

FontStyle.js styles table cells with inline styling. It can easily be bypassed.

## Local implementation

Repo: https://github.com/sligtenberg/job-applicant-report/tree/main  
Node Version: v20.11.0  

To run on a development server:  
 - Clone the repo down to your local environment.
 - Install dependencies: $ npm install

If you are on a mac, the following commands should work:

 - Start development server: $ json-server data.json
  - In a separate terminal window run the frontend in a browser: $ npm start

If you are using Windows, try the following instead:

 - You may need to install json_server: $ npm i json-server
 - Start development server: npx json-server data.json
 - Change the start script in /package.json to: "start": "set PORT=4000 && react-scripts start"
 - In a separate terminal window run the frontend in a browser: $ npm start

## Test files

To see how the frontend handles incomplete data such as a job with no applicants, or an applicant with missing information, use data2.json. To test other cases, create new json files in the root directory and open with json-server.

For example: $ json-server data3.json

## Future plans and other notes

 - Build a server. This is a frontend only MVP for the code challenge. We implement a lightweight json server which serves data in three separate arrays and fails to make use of the relational nature of our database. The next step is to build a real server and serve the data as an object. The backend should construct this object based on the relationships between data.

 - At this time, we create a static html page, meaning React is pretty unnecessary and we could just use Vanilla JavaScript. However, if we wish to add the capacity to modify data through this page, React will be helpful.
